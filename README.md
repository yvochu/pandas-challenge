Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
PyCitySchools Analysis Summary
In this assignment, we used pandas to analyze data from 15 schools.
Two key conclusions can be drawn from the analysis:
1.	School Type: The type of school does not significantly affect the average math and reading scores.
2.	School Size: Larger schools tend to have lower average math and reading scores compared to small and medium-sized schools.
